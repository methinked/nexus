    3. External HDD (/dev/sda1 at /mnt/data): 465.8 GB, nearly empty ✓
  - **Type detection verified:**
    - mmcblk devices correctly identified as SD_CARD
    - sda device with rotational=1 correctly identified as EXTERNAL_HDD
  - **Smart storage recommendation:**
    - Correctly recommended /mnt/data (external HDD) for Docker/logs
    - Meets minimum free space requirements (465.2 GB free)
  - **Metrics flowing to Core:**
    - Disk percentage: 14.4% (root filesystem) ✓
    - Backward compatibility maintained ✓
    - Agent running successfully with new code ✓

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses psutil.disk_partitions() for disk enumeration
- Reads Linux kernel /sys/block/* for device properties
- Filters virtual filesystems (tmpfs, devtmpfs, squashfs, overlay)
- Detects data location by checking file paths
- Sorts disks: root filesystem first, then alphabetically

## 🔑 Key Architectural Decisions

1. **FastAPI Everywhere:** Using FastAPI for both Core and Agent for consistency, modern async support, and native WebSocket capabilities.

2. **Local Network First:** Design assumes local network connectivity by default. VPN (ZeroTier/Tailscale) is an optional layer for remote access.

3. **SQLite for Core:** Simple, file-based database sufficient for managing a fleet of Raspberry Pis.

4. **CLI-First Development:** Every feature gets a CLI command before a web UI.

5. **Modular Agent Components:** Each agent module (Speculum, Imperium, Scriptor, Arbiter) is independently deployable.

## 🐛 Known Issues

None yet - project just initialized!

---

## 💡 Ideas / Future Considerations

- Consider adding mDNS/Avahi for local network discovery
- Investigate SQLite performance limits for fleet size
- Plan for graceful degradation when Core is unreachable
- Consider adding a "local mode" where Agent can function independently
- Explore using NATS or Redis for pub/sub if fleet grows large
- Add metrics dashboard using something lightweight (htmx + charts?)

---

## 📝 Notes

- Keep this file updated at each significant milestone
- Document blockers and decisions here for future reference
- Update "Last Updated" date when making changes

### Development Environment
- **Primary Dev:** Linux laptop (x86_64)
- **Test Deployment:** Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (ARMv7/v8, 1GB RAM)
- **Considerations:** Keep resource usage low for Pi3 constraints

### Performance Guidelines for Pi3
- Limit concurrent jobs to 1-2 per node
- Optimize Docker images for ARM architecture
- Use async patterns to maximize limited CPU
- Monitor memory usage carefully (only 1GB available)

**Phase 7.2 Complete: 2025-12-02** 🎉

### UI Fixes & Improvements

**Health Status Display Issues Resolved:**
- [x] Fixed "undefined" display in health status cards (commit `6b980c0`)
  - Issue: Template was accessing wrong field paths
  - Fix: Changed to `healthStatus.latest_metrics.cpu_percent` format
- [x] Added temperature card to health status display (commit `0b2f611`)
  - Changed grid from 4 to 5 columns
  - Shows temperature with °C unit and color coding
  - Falls back to 'N/A' if sensor unavailable
- [x] Fixed health status value comparisons (commit `7e562bc`)
  - Issue: API returns lowercase ("healthy") but template checked uppercase ("HEALTHY")
  - Fix: Updated all comparisons to lowercase, display still shows uppercase via `.toUpperCase()`

**Multi-Disk Display Implementation:**
- [x] Agent disk information endpoint (commit `319f5e6`)
  - GET /api/system/disks - Returns all mounted disks with DiskInfo
  - Uses existing `get_all_disks()` from Phase 6.5.1
- [x] Core disk information proxy (commit `319f5e6`)
  - GET /api/nodes/{node_id}/disks - Fetches from agent
  - Validates response and handles communication errors
- [x] Web dashboard storage devices section (commit `319f5e6`)
  - Displays all disks with mount points and device paths
  - Color-coded disk type badges (SD Card, External SSD, External HDD, NVMe, USB Flash)
  - Usage percentages with color-coded progress bars (green/amber/red)
  - Free space in human-readable format
  - Special badges: System, Docker Data, Nexus Data, Read-Only
  - Helper functions: `formatDiskType()` and `formatBytes()`
- [x] Storage error handling (commit `29e6fd5`)
  - Shows clear error message when agent lacks endpoint
  - Displays update instructions with command
  - Prevents "undefined" from appearing

### Error Handling Standards Established

**CRITICAL RULE Documented (commit `bbea328`):**
> All error messages must be clear, actionable, and avoid "undefined" or generic failures.

**New Documentation: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`**
- [x] Error message clarity principles (what, why, how)
- [x] Good vs bad error message examples
- [x] Frontend error handling checklist
  - Always provide fallback values: `value || 'N/A'`
  - Check data existence: `value?.property`
  - Show error states explicitly with flags
  - Track loading/error/empty states separately
- [x] Backend error handling checklist
  - Use appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Include context in error messages
  - Provide actionable next steps
  - Log errors with full details
- [x] Testing error scenarios checklist
  - API 404/500 responses, timeouts, malformed data
  - Missing/null fields, empty arrays
  - Agent offline scenarios
- [x] Error message templates for common cases
- [x] Code review checklist for error handling

**Frontend Error Handling Patterns:**
```javascript
// Always provide fallbacks
x-text="value || 'N/A'"
x-text="value ? value.toFixed(1) + '%' : 'N/A'"

// Check existence before operations
x-text="data?.field ? data.field.toUpperCase() : 'Unknown'"

// Track error state
data: [],
error: false,
errorMessage: '',
async loadData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/data');
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Server returned ${response.status}`);
        this.data = await response.json();
        this.error = false;
    } catch (e) {
        this.error = true;
        this.errorMessage = e.message || 'Unknown error';
    }
}
```

**Backend Error Handling Patterns:**
```python
# Specific status codes and context
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=404,
    detail=f"Node {node_id} not found. It may have been deleted."
)

# Include actionable information
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=503,
    detail=f"Cannot communicate with agent at {node_ip}. Agent may be offline."
)
```

### Roadmap Updates
